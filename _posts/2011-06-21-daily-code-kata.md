A daily code kata is every day implement the same non-trivial algorithm in a different way.

My assumption was that a daily code kata would force me to learn different things every day. I got this tip from the founder of the pragmatic programmer, Dave Thomas. He suggested that a code kata is 1) an oasis where it is ok to relax without a deadline and thereby have the time to really learn something new and 2) learn how to play with code, reflect, refine and measure code.

My routine goes something like this, I start with an empty workspace and pick one of the many different suggested katas by <a title="Daves katas" href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_backg.html" target="_blank">Dave </a> or by <a title="Google" href="http://www.google.se/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=codekata" target="_blank">google</a> and then just go with the flow. Sometimes I feel like using Regex (btw, have you read the <a title="How ‘Derive scope from Goal’ helped my client to choose a non-technical solution" href="http://gunnarahlberg.com/2011/06/21/regex-joke/" target="_blank">joke about regex?</a>)

Then, I just code until I feel happy. And I feel happy every day!

Try it you to, it helped me to get better insights in different java libraries, javascript, ruby, how to implement a simple test library, regex, maven, eclipse projects among all the little things. The beauty of it all is that I don't store the code anyhow. I just throw it away when I don't feel like having it around.

My hypothesis is that a daily rhythm make me remember to learn this every day. Love it.
