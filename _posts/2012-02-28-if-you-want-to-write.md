So, the other day I got a long list of books to read from circle of friends. We collected titles togehter on a maillist and the conversation abruptly swayed from "Blink" to "Clean Code" and so on. Most of the titles were ones that I had heard of and some that I've read. And some interesting titles that I never heard of, one was "If you want to write" by Brenda Ueland.

I'm at lost of words on this book. It's so tightly written, less than hundred pages yet full of interesting discussion on various topics. The best part is how Brenda really fuels the energy into me as a reader and a writer. Just let it out, write, scribble, type. 

The book really thinks that most of us can be an excellent author, at the end there is even lackmus test, black and white, if you can do this, then you can be an excellent author. And it's not about the way you put the words, like, when you write an article on a topic that emphasise the important stuff in the beginning and so on. 

It's not about the tools you use. How I've procastinated on that! So much time can be spent on thinking about various moleskins, papers, typewriters. Or the tools you chose to plan the work. 

It's about how you tell a story. And most of us can tell a story. Most of us can tell a child a story and the child will listen. That means we are able to tell a story.
