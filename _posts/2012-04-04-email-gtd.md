Someone mentioned something called "the secret weapon" and it targeted email. I read it because it mentioned one of my favourite tools, "Evernote", something I've used for almost a year now. Combined with another excellent tool - "zero inbox". Can you imagine what it feels like to open your email client and there is nothing there? It's great - I've done that for many years.
 
Check out <http://www.thesecretweapon.org/imap-setup>, try it, it's a great way to handle email, filter them to tasks, prioritize, act and archive the ones that are good for reference. Go ahead, it takes 15 minutes to setup and I promise that this technique can save you more than an hour per day!
