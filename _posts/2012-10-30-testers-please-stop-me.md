Please, testers, stop me from low quality. And here is my plea, stop verification and start lead.

I'm a developer and surely something will brake. And that is my resposibility to fix, not a testers. However, as a tester, you are probably much better at finding out why and what test to automate.. Why is some parts harder to test than others?

And as a developer, I can help any tester with design and architecture to enable tests. But only if you help me with why.

Put the testers in your team to be thought leaders in how to produce fewer defects rather than the toll gate before code is installed in production.
